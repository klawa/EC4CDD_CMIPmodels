## Abstract

Climate models almost unanimously project the exacerbation of dry extremes in many world regions in the future. Simultaneously, confidence in the magnitude and timing of projected changes remains low, leaving societies largely unprepared⁠. Here we propose a new emergent constraint (EC) on the simplest but core indicator of drought, the lack of rainfall, expressed as the longest annual dry spell (LAD). Using two generations of climate models, we uncover global regions where historical LAD biases affect the magnitude of projected LAD increases, and explore the role of land–atmosphere feedbacks therein. Constraining model projections with observations using the new EC reduces the uncertainty in future predictions by 10–26% globally and reveals a 42–44% higher LAD increase than in “mid-range” or “high-end” future forcing scenarios. Our results imply that the end-of-century global land-only LAD could be on average 10 days longer than expected. Our findings expose regions with potentially higher- and earlier-than-expected drought risks for societies and ecosystems, and they point to possible mechanisms underlying the biases in the current generation of climate models.
